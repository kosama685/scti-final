<p><strong>9. SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE</strong></p>

<p>9.1. When you sign up to our Subscription Service you agree to pay the applicable fees that apply to the Tier you have signed up to (&ldquo;Subscription Fees&rdquo;). The applicable Subscription Fees will be notified to you at the time you set up your subscription and are payable monthly.</p>

<p>9.2. You must provide us with at least one Payment Method when setting up your subscription. &quot;Payment Method&quot; means a current, valid, accepted method of payment. You must keep your Payment Method up to date and ensure the details are correct. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided to us by the payment service providers. Following any such change, you authorise us to continue charging the applicable Payment Method(s).</p>

<p>9.3. By agreeing to these Terms, you authorise us to charge the monthly Subscription Fees for each billing cycle to your Payment Method, in arrears, on the 28<sup>th</sup> day of each month (or where such day is not a business day, on the next business day). Where you have purchased you subscription part way through a month, your first month&rsquo;s Subscription Fees will be a reduced amount proportionate to your usage. If you cancel your subscription before your next billing date, we will charge your Payment Method for one final month&rsquo;s worth of Subscription Fees, following which no further payments will be taken from your Payment Method.</p>

<p>9.4. There may be occasions where your billing date changes, such as if we try to charge your Payment Method but are unable to take the payment (in which case you authorise us to continue attempting to charge your Payment Method until the payment has successfully been made).</p>

<p>9.5. You authorise us to charge any Payment Method attached to your subscription in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available for us to take payment of the Subscription Fees. You remain responsible for any unpaid amounts until they have been successfully paid. If a payment of Subscription Fees is not successfully made, for any reason, and you have not or do not cancel your subscription, we may suspend your access to the Website until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. You may be charged certain fees by the issuer of certain Payment Methods (e.g., foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method). Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. You should check with your Payment Method service provider for details of such charges.</p>

<p>9.6. You can cancel your subscription at any time for any reason through your Account dashboard, by following the instructions on-screen. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to the Subscription Service until the end of the active billing period at the time of your cancellation, at which time your access to the Subscription Service shall cease and no further payment shall be charged to your Payment Method. You will still have access to our Website following termination of the Subscription Service.</p>

<p>9.7. Subject to your legal rights as a consumer, we do not provide refunds or credits for the remainder of any billing period after your cancellation. Where you have a right under law to terminate your subscription with immediate effect because of something we have done wrong, then we will refund you for one month&rsquo;s worth of Subscription Fees.</p>

<p>9.8. We may change our Tiers and the price of the Subscription Services from time to time. However, we will always give you 30 days&rsquo; notice in advance of any price changes or changes to your subscription, during which time you will be able to cancel your subscription in accordance with clause 9.6.</p>

<p>13.1.1. obtain sufficient information for Employers to select a suitable jobseeker for the position which the Employer seeks to fill;</p>
